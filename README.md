### Project Info

Application is a responsive Netflix clone built using React and Tailwind CSS. It includes user registration functionality that is powered by Firebase, allowing users to sign up and log in to the app. Also implemented data fetching for movies, using an external API to populate the app with movie information.

To improve the user experience, I've implemented React Router and Context, which enables users to navigate through the app and ensures that important data is accessible throughout the app. Use of Tailwind CSS allowed you me create responsive interface, ensuring that the app looks great and works well on all devices.

Overall, my Netflix clone project demonstrates my proficiency in React, Tailwind CSS, as well as my ability to use external APIs and libraries to create a functional and visually appealing web app.
